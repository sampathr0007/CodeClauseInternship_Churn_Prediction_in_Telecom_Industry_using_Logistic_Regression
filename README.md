# CodeClauseInternship_Churn_Prediction_in_Telecom_Industry_using_Logistic_Regression
A Telecom company is losing Customers to its competitors. With the historical customer churn information that they have, they want a ML Model to predict, which of their present customers may churn.   For this task I have used `Logistic Regression` model to solve the problem. 

The input data is spread over 3 separate files - `churn_data.csv`, `cust_data.csv` and `internet_data.csv` taken from kaggle.

The Data includes the following: 

- `Personal Data (gender, children, whether senior citizen, dependents...)`
- `Services Related (Tenure with the provider, payment method, internet packs purchased, special offers...)`
- `Charges being incurred (Amount of recharge done per month...)`
